Hello, 

I'm contacting you to coordinate what home equipment you will need. Here is a list of the items we usually check out to our employees. We can provide you with everything listed below, a few of the items, or none of it. Just let us know what you would like. 

- 1 or 2 24" Monitors
- Mouse
- Keyboard
- Headset
- USB-C Adapter for monitors and peripherals
- USB Webcam

We will, of course, be providing a laptop and the necessary cables.
Please send us your address so we can ship the items to you! Also, please include a good contact number for Amazon as they deliver all of our shipments and sometimes need extra help finding locations.
Also, be on the lookout for another email from me about 1Password, our password manager.

Thanks,
Abe
